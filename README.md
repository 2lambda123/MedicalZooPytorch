# Medical Zoo Pytorch
Our goal is to implementent an open-source medical image segmentation library of state of the art 3D deep neural networks in PyTorch along with data loaders of the most common medical MRI datasets. The first stable release of our repository is almost ready. We strongly believe in open and **reproducible deep learning research**. This project started as an MSc Thesis and is currently under further development.

## Beta release - work in progress!
Although this work was initially focused on **3D multi-modal brain MRI segmentation** we are slowly adding more architectures and dataloaders. Stay tuned!

## New released cool features (03/2020)

1. Batch size training support
2. On the fly 3D total volume vizualization
3. Tensorboard and PyTorch 1.4 support to track training progress
3. Code cleanup and package creation
4. Offline sub-volume generation 
5. Add Hyperdensenet, 3DResnet-VAE, DenseVoxelNet
6. Fix mrbrains dataloader
7. Add MICCAI 2019 gleason challenge
8. Add confusion matrix support for understaning training dynamics
