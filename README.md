# Medical Zoo Pytorch
Our goal is to implementent an open-source medical image segmentation library of state of the art 2D/3D deep neural networks in PyTorch along with data loaders of the most common medical MRI datasets. The first stable release of our repository is expected to be publised in the end of September. 
We strongly believe in open and reproducible deep learning research.
In order to reproduce our results, the code (alpha release) and materials of this work are available in this repository.
This project started as an MSc Thesis and is currently under further development.

I deeply thank my partner @IliasPap for accepting my invitaton to further develop this project.

## Alpha release - work in progress

Although this work was focused on 3D multi-modal brain MRI segmentation we will slowly add more architectures and dataloaders.

## Top priorities

1. Docker image for installation guide
2. Documentation
3. Brats2018 dataloaders
4. Examples

## Implemented dataloaders

ISEG 2017
MRBRAINS2018

## Implemented architectures

Densenet3D (1-stream, 2-stream and 3-stream)
Unet3D
Vnet + lighter version
