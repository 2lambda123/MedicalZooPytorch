We strongly believe in open and **reproducible deep learning research**. Our goal is to implement an open-source medical image segmentation library of state of the art 3D deep neural networks in PyTorch. We also implemented a bunch of data loaders of the most common medical image datasets. **The first stable release of our repository is almost ready.**  This project started as an MSc Thesis and is currently **under further development.** 

Although this work was initially focused on **3D multi-modal brain MRI segmentation** we are slowly adding more architectures and data-loaders. Stay tuned! **More** updates are coming...

## Quick Start
- If you want to quickly understand the fundamental concepts, we strongly advice to check our [blog post](https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/ "MedicalZooPytorch article"), which provides a high level overview of all the aspects of medical image segmentation and deep learning. 
- Alternatively, you can create a **virtual environment** and install the requirements. Check the installation folder for more instructions.
- You can also take a quick glance at the [manual](./manual/README.md).
- If you do not have a capable environment or device to run this projects then you could give Google Colab a try. It allows you to run the project using a GPU device, free of charge. You may try our Colab demo using this notebook:[![Open In Colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/black0017/MedicalZooPytorch/blob/master/Quickstart_MedicalZoo.ipynb)
