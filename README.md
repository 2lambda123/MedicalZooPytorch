# Medical Zoo Pytorch
We strongly believe in open and reproducible deep learning research. In order to reproduce our results, the code (alpha release) and materials of this thesis are available in this repository. The first stable release of our repository is expected to be publised in the end of September.

## Alpha release - work in progress
A comparative analysis of multi-modal brain-MRI segmentation with 3D deep neural networks 

This MSc Thesis is focused on multi-modal brain segmentation. For our experiments, we used two common benchmark datasets(ISEG 2017 & MRBRAINS2018) from MICCAI MRI image challenges. Brain MR segmentation challenges aim to evaluate state-of-the-art methods for the segmentation of brain by providing a 3D MRI dataset with ground truth tumor segmentation labels annotated by physicians. In order to evaluate state-of-the-art 3D architectures, we briefly analyze the authorâ€™s approaches, as well as to provide the reader with an intuition behind the design choices. We perform a comparative analysis of the baseline architectures through extensive evaluations. The implemented networks were based on the specifications of the original papers. Finally, we discuss the reported results and provide future directions for implementing an open-source medical segmentation library in PyTorch along with data loaders of the most common medical MRI datasets.
