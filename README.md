# Medical Zoo Pytorch
Our goal is to implementent an open-source medical image segmentation library of state of the art 3D deep neural networks in PyTorch along with data loaders of the most common medical MRI datasets. The first stable release of our repository is almost ready. We strongly believe in open and **reproducible deep learning research**. This project started as an MSc Thesis and is currently under further development.

## Beta release - work in progress!
Although this work was initially focused on **3D multi-modal brain MRI segmentation** we are slowly adding more architectures and dataloaders. Stay tuned!

## Quick Start
- If you want to quickly understand the foundamental concepts we strongly advice to check our [blog post](https://theaisummer.com/medical-image-deep-learning/ "MedicalZooPytorch article"), which provides a high level overview of all the aspects of medical image segmentation and deep learning. 

- Alternatively, you can create a virtual enviroment and install the requirements. Check installation folder for more instructions.
