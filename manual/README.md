# Medical ZOO: Manual

![](https://img.shields.io/github/license/black0017/MedicalZooPytorch)

### Basics
- All models accept the input the channels(in_channels) and the segmentation classes(classes) as the first two parameters and produce un-normalized outputs
- All losses accept as input the pred in 5D shape of [batch,classes,dim_1,dim_2,dim_3] and 4D target shape of [batch, dim_1, dim_2, dim_3]. It is converted to one-hot inside the loss function for consistency reasons. Furthermore the normalization of the predictions is handled here. Dice-based losses return the scalar loss for backward(), and the prediction per channels in numpy to track training progress
